# SmokeSim
## Simulated smoke billowing up within a fluid

Utilised Phiflow library to simulate the development of smoke billow within a a fluid (liquid or gas). 

The simulation environment is within a standard square x,y box that contains a staggered grid of the velocities at each position and a standard grid containing the smoke position.

There will be a constant influx of smoke at the bottome middle of the plotted box to better show the full development of the smoke billow.
